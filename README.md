# JavaScriptQuiz

## Description

This is a quiz that tests your knowledge of JavaScript concepts.  It was created to integrate my knowledge of JavaScript with HTML and CSS.  The quiz not only asks you questions and increments your score or decrements your time, but it also saves highscores to local storage which can be accessed at any point.

## Usage

  When you click "Start Quiz" a quiz begins that tests you on JavaScript concepts.  One by one, a new question will display.  If you answer a question correctly, your score will be incremented by one.  If you answer a question wrong, 10 seconds are subtracted from your quiz time.  After you run out of time or complete the quiz (whichever comes first), your score is displayed and you have the option of submitting your name for a high score.  If you hit submit, the high score list is displayed and you can choose to either clear it or go back and retake the quiz.  Additionally, from the beginning of the quiz, you can access the highscore page from the top left of the screen by clicking the "View Highscores" button.
